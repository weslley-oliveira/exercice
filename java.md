# Java

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ ./gradlew install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ ./gradlew test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore("Remove to run test")` annotation.
